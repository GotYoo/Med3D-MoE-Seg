# Lung Nodule Knowledge
Pulmonary nodules are small round or oval-shaped growths in the lungs, typically less than 3 cm in diameter. They are often detected incidentally on chest CT scans.
Ground-glass opacity (GGO) refers to hazy increased lung attenuation with preservation of bronchial and vascular margins, which may represent early-stage adenocarcinoma.
Solid pulmonary nodules appear as homogeneous soft-tissue attenuation lesions. Spiculated margins suggest malignancy and require further evaluation.
Subsolid nodules include both pure ground-glass and part-solid nodules. Part-solid nodules have higher malignancy risk than pure GGOs.

# CT Imaging Characteristics
The Fleischner Society provides guidelines for management of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules based on size and patient risk factors.
Calcification patterns in pulmonary nodules can help determine benignity: central, diffuse, laminated, or popcorn calcifications typically indicate benign lesions.
Enhancement patterns on contrast-enhanced CT can help differentiate malignant from benign nodules. Malignant nodules typically show greater enhancement.

# Lung Cancer Staging
Lung cancer staging follows the TNM classification system: T describes tumor size and extent, N describes lymph node involvement, M describes distant metastases.
Stage I lung cancer is confined to the lung without lymph node involvement. Stage IA tumors are ≤3 cm, Stage IB are >3 cm but ≤4 cm.
Stage II lung cancer involves larger tumors or limited lymph node spread. Stage IIA includes tumors >4 cm but ≤5 cm with no lymph node involvement.

# Common Findings
Emphysema is characterized by permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to terminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls.
Pulmonary fibrosis shows reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing on HRCT, typically with a basal and peripheral predominant distribution.
Pneumonia appears as airspace consolidation with air bronchograms on chest radiographs and CT. Lobar distribution suggests bacterial etiology.

# Anatomical Landmarks
The right lung has three lobes (upper, middle, lower) while the left lung has two lobes (upper, lower) with a lingula.
The carina is the bifurcation point of the trachea into the right and left main bronchi, located at the level of the T4-T5 vertebrae.
Mediastinal compartments include anterior (thymus, lymph nodes), middle (heart, great vessels), and posterior (esophagus, descending aorta) divisions.

# Measurement Standards
Lung nodule measurement should follow RECIST criteria: maximum diameter in axial plane on lung window settings.
Volumetric analysis provides more accurate nodule growth assessment compared to linear measurements, especially for small nodules.

# Risk Factors
Smoking history is the strongest risk factor for lung cancer. Pack-years calculation: (packs per day) × (years smoked).
Occupational exposures including asbestos, radon, and chromium increase lung cancer risk. Asbestos exposure can cause both lung cancer and mesothelioma.

# Follow-up Recommendations
Lung-RADS categories provide standardized reporting and management recommendations for lung cancer screening CT exams.
Solid nodules <6 mm typically require no routine follow-up in low-risk patients. Nodules 6-8 mm may require 6-12 month follow-up.
Ground-glass nodules ≥6 mm typically require follow-up at 3-6 months to assess for persistence, then annual surveillance.

# Differential Diagnosis
Solitary pulmonary nodule differential includes: primary lung cancer, metastasis, granuloma, hamartoma, arteriovenous malformation, and infectious causes.
Multiple pulmonary nodules suggest metastatic disease, granulomatous infection, vasculitis, or miliary tuberculosis depending on distribution pattern.

# Treatment Considerations
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an option for early-stage lung cancer in patients who are not surgical candidates.
Wedge resection, segmentectomy, and lobectomy are surgical options for early-stage lung cancer, with lobectomy being the standard of care for stage I disease.
